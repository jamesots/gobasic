A BASIC Compiler for ARM (specifically, Raspberry PI), written in Go.

This is just me playing with Go, ARM assembly and my Raspberry PI. It is not
a well designed programme. In fact, so far, it only supports two keywords:
PRINT and GO. And only in upper case. And if you put bad characters in your
strings it won't work. And it compiles to assembly, so you need an assembler too. 
Anyway, it isn't very good, but it's fun for me.

New:
Really basic for loops
Can print integer variables
