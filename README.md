A BASIC Compiler for ARM (specifically, Raspberry PI), written in Go.

This is just me playing with Go, ARM assembly and my Raspberry PI. It is not
a well designed programme. In fact, so far, it only supports two keywords:
PRINT and GO. And only in upper case. And if you put bad characters in your
strings it won't work. It will also only compile a programme called prog.bas.
And it compiles to assembly, so you need an assembler too. 
Anyway, it isn't very good, but it's fun for me.
